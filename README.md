# Grouping of customers based on their store purchase history 
Hello Everyone.  
<br>
This project is done as one of my tasks from my internship from PRODIGY INFOTECH.  
<br>
Here I've implmented K-Means Clustering Algorithm which helps us to group people based on their purchases on store.  <br>
<br>
The Dataset,I used is taken from kaggle , ___link___=(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python)   
<br>
The DATASET file contains the basic information (ID, age, gender, income, spending score) about the customers.  
<br>
I've also uploaded the dataset file for ease of search in the Files tab.  
<br>
### Steps invoved are:
1) Dropping / Trimming Data of incomplete or Un-necessary values.
2) Then we find WCSS values of the customers.
3) Plot an Elbow Graph.
4) Finally plot the graph which shows the cluster of cutomers.
